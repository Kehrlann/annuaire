Game plan for importing :
[x] Read CSV file into correct struct
[x] Have an empty version of the DB as a docker file
[x] Try adding new data to it
[ ] Don't forget adding entreprises
[ ] Dump the existing data into a newly formed DB
[ ] Generate all necessary secondary data (words, tsvectors)
[ ] Push to prod
